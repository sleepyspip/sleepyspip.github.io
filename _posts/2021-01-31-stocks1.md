# Shorts, stocks, and two smoking barrels

> *"Bearish GameStop options contracts fly off the shelf after stock surge"* 

That was the headline that caught my eye as I was looking for more information on the recent financial drama. If you haven't heard of it yet it seems from what I could gathered that the GameStop action has had a fantastic surge under the influence of the *r/wallstreetbets* retail investors, the reddit crowd putting a huge pressure on the shorting hedge funds as the situation gets closer to a short-squeeze.

Now I have a confession to make, I understand very little of what I just wrote. In fact, if the above-mentioned quote grabbed my attention, it is because it was a migraine inducing reminder that I have little to no financial literacy. Shorts, stocks, hedge funds, all of these are words that I have heard countless times -be it in the news or Sunday night's blockbuster- but have never really caught the meaning of. And what's that about bears ? Now we got animals thrown into the mix ?! Well today I decided to use my blessed ego as motivation to finally sit down and take the time to grasp these concepts. And we're going to do that together.

## Welcome to the Jungle

I have to say, I was quite curious to know how bears fit in the financial zoo. After a quick search (yes, I typed "what is a bear?" in Google), I found the answer on a website (investopedia.com) we will keep going back to in this article:

> A bear is an investor who believes that a particular security, or the broader market is headed downward and may attempt to profit from a decline in stock prices. Bears are typically pessimistic about the state of a given market or underlying economy. ^[[1]]

Ok, the first sentence is a bit of a headache, but I gather that a bear is a person who thinks the price will go down, so to be bearish means expecting the price to go down. Hey, it's not as scary said like that! It does however brings the immediate question: what animal are you if you think the price will go up ? A bull ! It appears the name were given in reference to the way those beasts attack their opponent: a bull will thrust its horns up into the air, while a bear will swipe down.

We also understand now why there is a famous bull statue in the financial district of New York:

That's one thing down, but we've conveniently left out an important detail: the price of *what* ? Well of the stock of course! What is a stock then ?

> A stock is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares." ^[[2]]

Or as Wikipedia puts it:
> Stock (also capital stock) of a corporation is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided. In American English, the shares are collectively known as "stock". A single share of the stock represents fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. ^[[3]]

Ok it seems that a *stock* is a representation of ownership of a corporation, so after you buy its *stock*, you own part of it. And the number of *shares* (or *unit of stocks*) determines how much of the corporation you own. Before the age of the internet, when you bought stocks you used to receive a *stock certificate*, a piece of paper acting as proof that you do, indeed, own part of the company. ^[[4]]

</figure>

Let's say you're interested in buying the corporation A's stock, whose price is 100$. Assuming that you want to invest 2000$ worth, you buy 20 shares of company A and now own part of it. How much ? Well if the total number of shares of that company is 100, that would be 20% in our overly simplified situation.

While nowadays *stocks* (plural) and *shares* seem to be often used interchangeably, they actually have their own nuances. Someone saying "I own 100 stocks" could mean 20 shares from corporation A & 80 from corporation B for example, but would often be used to mean "I own shares in 100 different companies". On the other hand "I own 100 shares" would mean a 100 of the same company and would often prompt a follow-up ("I own 100 shares *in company A*"). Shares only make sense in the context of one company.

Now you've probably noticed that I have used *corporation* and *company* somewhat interchangeably. Corporation is often colloquially used to mean big company, but is actually based on a more specific concept:

> A corporation is an organization—usually a group of people or a company—authorized by the state to act as a single entity ^[[5]]

However, this is the extent to which I will go into their differences.*Company* and *corporation* are terms dependent on the legal framework of your region. So depending where you are, the words can mean different things. I will loosely use them as synonyms here, even if it might be interesting to look at the differences in the legal definition in your locality.


Now if you're anything like me, you might be wondering how come you can go and buy part of other companies, and what ownership means in this context. 

I have stumbled upon [this wonderful booklet](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf "If You Can - How Millennial Can Get Rich Slowly") written by William L. Bernstein, an American financial theorist. Among from the wealth of interesting advices and accessible explanations is this little bit:

> Say you're starting a business. It'll be a bit before it starts making money, but from day one it'll have expenses, and you'll need money for that up front.
> 
> You can get that money in one of two ways: you can borrow it from relatives, friends, or from a bank, or you can sell an ownership interest to a friend or family member. For example, if your brother is half owner, he's entitled to half of all of your business's future earnings. ^[[6]]

Note the use of "interest" here. When people say they have 20% interest in a company, it refers to ownership interest, and means they have 20% of the company's shares. So a shareholder (*someone who holds shares of a company*) has some ownership of the company and  the amount of which, called the *interest*, corresponds to the relative number of shares they possess.

The reason companies offer such fractional ownership is highlighted by Mr. Bernstein here: it is a form of financing. When having a lot of expenses to cover at once, it is an alternative to borrowing money. He continues:

> Nothing prevents you from doing both, and in fact that is what most large corporations do. If you do both borrow money *and* sell shares, then both legally and morally, you have to pay the lenders' interest and principal first. Only after they have been paid, and only after your other ongoing businesses expenses have been met, can you then pay out the remaining profits to you and your brother.
> 
> You and your brother are thus the "residual owners" of the business; if and only if, you can pay off your lenders and your expenses do you make any money. *From the investors' perspective, an ownership stake (a stock) is much riskier than a loan to your business (a bond), and so the stock deserves a higher expected return than a bond.* ^[[6]]

As he mentioned above, share ownership entitles you to the corresponding part of the future *profits* (earnings) of the company. That is, after the company's expenses have been paid: debtors will always come first. This also includes the case of bankruptcy: if the company becomes insolvent (i.e they cannot pay their debts), they are forced to sell their assets to pay their debts, and the money (the *profits* from the sale) go in priority to the lenders (debtors).

The ownership of a stock is somewhat limited compared to what we might expect: we own a right to the earnings of a company rather than the earnings itself, hence why the shareholder comes after the debtor when it comes to receiving their profit. That limited ownership does however also means you you have ‘limited liability’ for the debts of the company. That means you are only responsible for company debts up to the value of your shares: the only money you risk losing is the money you already put in.

Also, while holding shares do not mean you have any say in the management of the company's operation, you do have a voting right on some matters (at least in the case of *common stocks*):

>  A voting right is the right of a shareholder of a corporation to vote on matters of corporate policy, including decisions on the makeup of the board of directors, issuing new securities, initiating corporate actions like mergers or acquisitions, approving dividends, and making substantial changes in the corporation's operations. It is common for shareholders to voice their vote by proxy by mailing in their response or by relinquishing their vote to a third party proxy voter.
>
>Unlike the single vote right that individuals commonly possess in democratic governments, the number of votes a shareholder has corresponds to the number of shares he or she owns. Thus, somebody owning more than 50% of a company's shares can effect a majority of the vote and is said to have a controlling interest in the firm. ^[[7]]

Lots of new words here, and in particular one we have briefly seen before: security.

>The term "security" refers to a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation via stock; a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation represented by owning that entity's bond; or rights to ownership as represented by an option. ^[[8]]

That one is a mouthful ! Let's proceed step-by-step:

- *Fungibility* in economics basically mean interchangeability of its units ^[[9]] , meaning that for all intents and purposes there are no difference between two of its elementary components. For example, *stocks* are *securities*, and their units, *shares*, are all the same: the one share you own in company A is identical to the one your friend Bob owns. The difference comes from the number of these units you own.
- According to Investopedia, financial instruments are assets that can be traded, or they can also be seen as packages of capital that may be traded. A financial instrument is a real or virtual document representing a legal agreement involving any kind of monetary value.^[[10]] Or as Wikipedia puts it: financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties. They can be created, traded, modified and settled.^[[11]] It seems the definition is pretty broad, but you get the gist!
- Examples of securities include *stocks*, *bonds*, *option*. We saw briefly what a *bond* was above: a loan that you give to a company. We'll leave *option* for later. 

So in summary stocks are a type of security that grants the holder (the owner) some benefits. We can summarize these benefits of stock ownership in three categories^[[12]] :

- **Voting rights**: You may have the right to vote at the company’s annual shareholder meetings.
- **Dividends**: You may receive a share of the company’s profits.
- **Capital appreciation**: When the company’s stock price goes up, your shares increase in value (and when the price of a stock declines, the value of your shares fall).

We have mentioned the voting rights before, as well as the dividends, which are the distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders. It's worth noting that these two benefits are not always present for the shareholder. Indeed, non-voting stocks exist, and some stock might not pay any dividend. In the latter case the reason could be that the earnings fully reinvested in the company (equipment, R&D, etc.), leaving no dividend for the shareholders, or simply that there was no earnings. The timing and amount of the dividend is decided by the company's board of director, and must be approved by the shareholders through their voting rights. But then, you say, what if they don't have a voting right ? Well in this case the dividend is fixed and known beforehand.

Which leave us with the last benefit: capital appreciation. When the stock price goes up, the shares value goes up too. Which is nice for the holder because *financial instruments* (meaning *securities* meaning *stocks*) are tradable: if you buy a stock and its value increase, you can sell it and make a profit. When you do that, you are *trading*, in this case stocks for money and money for stocks. The places where you can do these trades, or exchanges, are thus called *stock exchange*. There are a lot of governmental regulations surrounding these trades, and the stock exchange themselves impose requirements and limitations on the stocks that can be traded. For example the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) requires a company to have issued at least a million shares of stock worth $100 million and must have earned more than $10 million over the last three years.^[[13]]

Since the money shareholder can make depend on the evolution of the stock price, they will try to anticipate its movement. Bears -who think the price will go down- will try to sell before its loses its value, while bulls -who think the price will go up- will try to buy more of it to make more profit in the future.

We are now getting close to being to understand the very first sentence of this article. One thing to go over before that: the *options*. We mentioned earlier that they were a type of security, therefore they are tradable, fungible and have a monetary value. What else? Let's see what Investopedia says on the matter:

>Options are financial instruments that are derivatives based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract they hold—the underlying asset.^[[14]]

We have a new word here: *derivative*. What is that ?! 

 >A derivative is a financial security with a value that is reliant upon or derived from, an underlying asset or group of assets—a benchmark. The derivative itself is a contract between two or more parties, and the derivative derives its price from fluctuations in the underlying asset.^[[15]]

Ok, so a derivative is a type of security; it makes sense since we just saw that an option is a form of derivative and an option is a security. The derivative gets its value from an *underlying asset*. Still hard to grasp for me, let's see what Wikipedia says about it:

>Derivatives are contracts between two parties that specify conditions (especially the dates, resulting values and definitions of the underlying variables, the parties' contractual obligations, and the notional amount) under which payments are to be made between the parties.^[[16]]

If I get that correctly, the derivatives are contracts that dictates conditions under which you buy or sell stuff (stuff being the *underlying*). It may be easier to understand what derivatives are by looking at examples. Some of the more common derivatives include:

- **forwards**: a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed on at the time of conclusion of the contract
- **futures**: a standardized legal agreement to buy or sell something at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future, between parties not known to each other
- **options**: a contract which conveys its owner, the holder, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a specified strike price prior to or on a specified date, depending on the form of the option
- **swaps**: an agreement between two counterparties to exchange financial instruments or cashflows or payments for a certain time

We kind of went full circle here, but it seems that in general derivatives are agreement to sell or buy a financial asset (the underlying) at a specified time (so not right now). Meaning they specify a date, and when that date comes, whatever action agreed upon in the contract will be taken at the price in the contract. 

If we go back to our options, it is a contract that specify a date at which we (holder of the option) will take the *option* to act (buy or sell) or not. So for example we have the option to sell, we will decide at that time if we want to sell or not the underlying for the agreed upon price (called strike price). There are two type of options^[[14]] : *Call options* (giving you the option to buy) and *Put options* (giving you the option to sell). An option contracts contain at the minimum the following things^[[17]] :

- whether the option holder has the right to buy (a call option) or the right to sell (a put option)
- the quantity and class of the underlying asset(s) (e.g., 100 shares of XYZ Co. B stock)
- the strike price, also known as the exercise price, which is the price at which the underlying transaction will occur upon exercise
- the expiration date, or expiry, which is the last date the option can be exercised. Note: some options only allow to exercise on the specific date and not before, thus having an exercise date instead of an expiry date. This options are called European options, as opposed to American options for the one with an expiration date.
- the settlement terms, for instance whether the writer must deliver the actual asset on exercise, or may simply tender the equivalent cash amount
- the terms by which the option is quoted in the market to convert the quoted price into the actual premium – the total amount paid by the holder to the writer

A quick example to wrap this up: let's say I buy from Bob *put options* of company A stocks at 100$ that expire on January 5th. This means I have the option to sell to Bob company A stocks at the price of 100$ (strike price) before the 5th of January (expiration date). This is interesting to me if I think the company A stock will not reach that price, meaning I can buy some share for cheaper (let's say 50$) and then sell them for the strike price (100$). If I decide to *exercise* the option, meaning using the right to sell at 100$ given by the option, Bob has to buy the stocks from me at that price.  The drawback (otherwise it would be too good!) is that I have to pay the option premium, which is in the price of the option, and is to be paid upfront. Sometimes however companies distribute these *stock options* to their employee as an incentive, who therefore do not have to pay the premium.

It is interesting to note that while in our previous case of *stock options* stocks are the underlying, the underlying can also be a derivative. Which means it is technically possible options on options. Which I suppose means it is also possible to have options on options on options and so on ... Actually one of the derivative at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis was the CDO (Collateralized Debt Obligation), and in particular its more complex forms such as the "CDO-squared" (a CDO with other CDO as underlyings) and synthetic CDOs (composed of various derivatives). This might be familiar to you if you have seen or read [The Big Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short_(film\)).


Finally it is time to go back to our introductory quote and see if we can make sense of it now:
>"Bearish GameStop options contracts fly off the shelf after stock surge"

The headline is about bearish options contract, meaning options for people expecting the value of the GameStop stock to go down. In other words, *put options*: they hope to sell at the agreed upon price because they expect it to go down, and therefore sell the stocks for more than their worth, thus making a profit. They appear to be selling very quickly (*fly off the shelf*) after the *stock surge*, in other words the spike of the price. It means that a lot of people expect this surge to be an unsustainable high for the price, expecting it to go down soon. You can try to read the article [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-stocks-options-idUSKBN29X0LE "Reuters - Bearish GameStop options contracts fly off the shelf after stock surge") and see if you can understand it now!
