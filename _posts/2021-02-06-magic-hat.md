Today I feel like making music ! Problem: I don’t know here to start. How do musicians create songs ? Well for now I am more interested in the melody than the lyrics so let’s start with that. 
Yes, but, how do they know which sound go well together ? Do they have some kind of magic hat where they pull the melody from ?

## The magic 4 chords

Have you ever heard of the magic 4 chords ? It was popularized on the internet quite some time ago by [The Axis of Awesome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ "4 Chords Music Video"), proving in a very entertaining musical skit that you don’t need to write overcomplicated melodies to find success. The theory is pretty straightforward: just repeat these four chords on a loop and you’ll be on your way to pop stardom.

So what are those chords ? Am, F, C and G; easy-peasy. Wait actually no, they are C, G, Am and F. Hmm that’s just the same chords in a different order, so I guess that’s the same? Well someone’s telling me D, A, Bm, G. Actually the real 4 chords are I V vi IV ? Wait, where did those roman numerals come from? What is going on here ?!

Let’s take a step back and breathe. We’ll go through it together from the beginning, one step at a time. First thing first, what’s a chord ?

>A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of pitches/frequencies consisting of multiple notes (also called "pitches") that are heard as if sounding simultaneously.[^1]

Ok, pretty straightforward, a chord is multiple notes played together in harmony. Let's leave aside for now what "harmonic" precisely implies here and just consider that it "sounds good" (we'll get back to that later). In fact, that's idea behind the etymology of the word *chord*, which is a shortening of *accord*, having this original meaning of agreement: notes that are in agreement with each other or better put form *harmonious sound*. For now let's take this simplified definition as our reference for what a chord is.

## Pitch perfect

Since our chords are made of notes, let's talk about them a bit.

> In music, a note is a symbol denoting a musical sound. In English usage a note is also the sound itself. [^2]

So the note is the symbol denoting the sound, but can also often be used to denote the sound itself. As you may know, sounds are vibrations (of the air usually) that are perceived by our ears. These individual sounds and therefore notes, can be identified by their frequency. When the frequency is higher, the note is perceived as higher by our ears, and similarly a lower frequency is identified by our ears as a lower *pitch*.

> Frequency is an objective, scientific attribute that can be measured. Pitch is each person's subjective perception of a sound wave, which cannot be directly measured. [^3]

So notes are sound we can perceive and that sound "musical", to which we have attributed symbols to identify them more easily.

You probably have heard about of A,B,C,D,E,F,G or Do,Re,Mi,Fa,Sol,La,Si. These are the basic seven notes in Western music. The two naming system are actually equivalent: A is La, B is Si, C is Do, D is Re, E is Mi, F is Fa (easy one), and G is Sol. So they have the same notes and order, they just have different names and a different starting point.[^2] 

You might wonder: well that's only 7 notes, there has to be more than that right ? There are indeed, but one note-worthy thing about notes is the *octave equivalence*. Notes (or *pitch*) are sounds of a certain frequency. When you double that frequency, the new note sound extremely similar to the ear, but *higher*: they are in perfect harmony. Therefore by convention they are named the same: the eight note (octave) is designated by the same letter. So if you go A,B,C,D,E,F,G, then higher, you fall back to A, a A that is twice higher but *sounds like an A*. So you can go as high as you want and describe a note with one of the 7 letters. If you want to be more precise, these letters are called the *pitch class*: the lower A and higher A are technically not the same pitch but are considered the same *pitch class*[^2]. However it is very common to say they're the same note, and to specify only when there is ambiguity, in which case one notation is to add a number to the letter. So for example A4 has a frequency twice higher as A3. 

There are also notes in between these seven letters:

- If you want describe a note that has been lowered a bit, you can add ♭ after, for example a bit lower D would be D♭. 
- If you want describe a note that has been raised a bit, you can add # after, for example a bit higher D would be D#. 

Actually if you have ever seen a piano, the "normal" notes are the white keys, and the black keys are these "in-between" notes with ♭ and #:

  <figcaption>White and black keys on the piano</figcaption>
</figure>

But wait you might ask, why are there some white keys with no black keys in-between ? Well not every set of two consecutive "normal" notes has a note in-between. It is possible to dive deeper in to the why, but at the end of the day it is a consequence of the standard western notation: it was decided over the centuries by western musicians that 12 notes in an octave was the sweet spot to have enough diversity but also instruments that are simple enough that they don't require 25 fingers and two brains to operate. And all consecutive notes in these twelve are separated by the same interval: when I talked about "lowering a bit" or "raising a bit", I was talking about lowering or raising by a *semitone* (also called a *half-step*). A *semitone* is the smallest interval musical interval in that convention[^4]. And some of the letters only have a semitone (half-step) between them while other have a whole step. Hence why some of the white keys have a black key between them while others do not. On thing though, on the piano from one key to the next (which is sometimes black sometimes white), there is one semitone. So you can think of the half-step as the difference between one key and the next.

Now one thing to keep in mind is that the letter names and semitones are a convention. There is nothing universal to them and the approach to music in some cultures has been quite different. The harmony between a note and one double its frequency (called *octave equivalence* in the system we have been using so far), however, is a universal phenomenon and a consequence of the mathematical properties of sound frequencies and how human beings perceive them. The way to divide the notes between two octaves is dependent on the system, and in fact some systems do not use the octave as a base.

But let's go back to the Western system, which is the most common nowadays. We can make a list of the notes with a semitone between them:

>A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#

And that's all we need, since by adding a semitone to G# we circle back to A ! In fact the semitone is often defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-note scale. 

## Scales

Wait what's a scale now ? Well a scale is any set of notes ordered by pitch. So our list of 12 notes above is a scale, actually called the *chromatic scale*. It contains all the pitch classes available. But we can make scales with less notes, as long as we order them properly: A,B,C,D,E,F,G is a scale as well. An interesting consequence of having all the pitches in our chromatic scale is that every other scale is as subset of the chromatic scale.

The point of having scales is to have tools to help identify what notes sound good together. This of course depends on the context, hence why there are so many different scales, depending on what kind of music you want to play. For example 7 notes scales (or *heptatonic scale*) are widely used in modern music, 8 notes scales are used in jazz and modern classical music, 5&6 notes scales are common in folk music, etc.

Critically, scales can help us create chords, by identifying what sounds that go well together. As we said before, heptatonic scales are widely used in modern music. The most fundamental ones are the Major and Minor scales. You build them by starting with a note (any note in the harmonic scale) and select the next one depending on the following pattern:

- Major: whole-step, whole-step, half-step, whole-step, whole-step, whole-step, half-step
- Minor: whole-step, half-step, whole-step, whole-step, half-step, whole-step, whole-step

So if we choose C as the starting point (*tonic*), the major scale is C,D,E,F,G,A,B and the minor scale is C,D,D#,F,G,G#,A#. We call them respectively the C major scale and C minor scale. If you ever had solfege or music classes at school, you probably had to sing Do-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La-Si-Do (or C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C); you were singing the C major scale.

The reason why scales are defined by a pattern rather than specifically picking out notes is fundamental: notes do not sound beautiful by themselves but in relation to each other. What is important in a melody is not so much the note themselves that the *interval* them. Do this little experiment: sing a simple melody, then sing it higher or lower. They will still feel like the same melody, and if you sing it to someone who knows the song, chances are they will recognize the melody even if it not sung in the same pitch as the original.

This is why it is better to think of scale as patterns that sound good, rather than a list of notes. Which is also why notes in a scale are designated by their *degree*, meaning the rank they have in the succession. The first is the tonic, which marks the starting point of the scale and give it its name, and noted I. Then comes the second II, the third III, the fourth IV, the fifth V, the sixth VI and finally the seventh VII degree. Notice the roman numerals? That's where they come from. 

Ok that's all and great but how does that relate to chords ? Well chords can be created from the scales. For example to make a C major chord (usually simply noted C), you take the tonic of the C major scale, and add the 3rd and 5th degree: E (III) and G (V). The degree III and V are universally recognized as the most consonant after the tonic, which is why these three degrees are used to form the basic chords. Those *triads* (3 notes chords) are the most fundamental ones, so they are noted as simply the *tonic* note:  C for example. You can also have the minor chord by using the minor scale instead of the major one: C(I)-D#(III)-G(V) for the C minor chord, noted Cm. You can of course add more than these three notes to make chords, in which case it will reflect in the name: adding the seventh degree to the C minor chord would be C(I)-D#(III)-G(V)-B(VII) and would be noted Cm7 to indicated that the seventh was added to Cm. 

But this is not all what scales can do for us. They can help us identify what chords sound good in succession, meaning what chord *progressions* are pleasing to the ear. As you remember, it is the relative intervals between the notes that is the most important part of the melody, and this is true also when working with chord progressions. That is how we designate a progression: by the degrees of the chord, for example I-IV-I-V is a progression that could be played C-F-C-G using the C major scale or D-G-D-A in the D minor scale. To designate minor chords, it is common to refer to the degree with a lower case such as vi, v, iii or iv. Also, the scale that forms the base of the progression (in other words, that fixes the degree I) is called the key. So C-F-C-G is the I-IV-I-V progression in the key of C major.

To go back to our magical 4 chords at the beginning, it happens that the I-V-vi-IV chord progression is one that works very well, and as such a very popular one. In the C major scale that progression translates to C-G-Am-F and D-A-Bm-G in the D major scale. Since this progression is meant to be repeated, it also works well when you switch the first and second half, for example Am-F-C-G. So all the example of these 4 chords we mentioned at the beginning are in reality the same chord progression.

This is great, because it means we can create our very own Magic Hat that will pop out a series of chord to play on repeat ! All we need to do is give him a key, and we'll have the core the melody for our next summer pop hit.


## Coding our Magic Hat


Since now we understand where the chord progressions comes from, let's get our hands dirty and create our own Magic Hat in Python:

```python
class MagicHat:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Our hat does nothing yet, but we're going to change that. **As we saw**, a chord progression gives us the relative degrees on a scale, not the specific chords. But we want our hat to give us a list of chords, so we don't have to think about anything and just be ready to rock. For that, we thus need to specify a scale.

```python
class MagicHat:
    def __init__(self, scale="C"):
        self.scale = generate_scale(scale)
```	        

We define the C major scale as the default one, since it's the simplest and often taken as the most basic one. But we don't want to write by hand all the scales, because that would be tedious, but also a pain to maintain in case we want to change or add new scales. So we define a `generate_scale` function, that will build the scale based on the base note (buy default C here).

```python
notes = ('A', 'A#', 'B', 'C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#')

def generate_scale(scale_name):
    tonic = scale_name.split("m")[0]
    i = notes.index(tonic)
    if "m" in scale_name:
        pattern = (0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10)  # (whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole)
    else:
        pattern = (0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11)  # (whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half)
    return tuple((notes[(i+j) % len(notes)] for j in pattern))
```
 
Before even going into the function, we write down all the notes in order. Each one is a semi-step higher than the previous one, which is going to be useful for us to generate the scale.

Onto the function now, first we identify the tonic by getting the first character of the input note name. This is so we in case we have major and minor scales.
We take the tonic's index in our *notes* tuple; it will be the starting point of the scale. Then depending on whether it's a minor scale (*X*m) or a major scale (*X*), we apply a different pattern for the steps:

- Major: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half
- Minor: whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole

So the base index `i` is given by the tonic, and each notes in the scale is found by adding the step offset `j` from the pattern. We want to indicate that the notes are cyclical, in other words that when we reach the end of the `notes` list, we wan to continue from the beginning. We do that by taking the [modulo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation> "Modulo - Wikipedia") (%) of the index. Our final tuple is created by iterating (...j.. for j in pattern) over the offsets in our pattern and creating a tuple out of it.

For example for the C scale our tonic index is 3, and our pattern (0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11). The function generates indeed the C major scale (C,D,E,F,G,A,B):

- C : index is 3+0 % 12, i.e 3 so we add notes[3], which is C
- D : index is 3+2 % 12 = 5 % 12 = 5, so we add notes[5]
- E : index is 3+4 % 12 = 7 % 12 = 7, so we add notes[7]
- F : index is 3+5 % 12 = 8 % 12 = 8, so we add notes[8]
- G : index is 3+7 % 12 = 10 % 12 = 10, so we add notes[10]
- A : index is 3+9 % 12 = 12 % 12 = 0, so we add notes[0]
- B : index is 3+11 % 12 = 14 % 12 = 2, so we add notes[2]

Now all we have to apply our chord progression patterns to our newly generated scale, so that our magic hats gives us the magic chords.

```python
class MagicHat:
    def __init__(self, scale="C"):
        self.scale = generate_scale(scale)
        self.magic_chords = self.generate_chords()
```

To do that we write our `generate_chords` function that will return the magic chords from a chord progression pattern and our scale:

```python
def generate_chords(self, progression="I, V, vi, IV"):
    chords = progression.replace(" ", "").split(",")
    rom_num = ["I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII"]
    return tuple((self.scale[rom_num.index(chord.upper())]+"m"*(chord == chord.lower()) for chord in chords))  # adds m if lowercase
```

We take the famous 4 chords progression as our default progression. Our function starts by transforming our input progression string into a list, removing the space and considering the elements as separated by a comma (we will have to input the chord progression in that format if we want to specify another one). We make a list of roman numerals so that we can convert them to numbers: we simply take their index in the list to find the associated note in the scale. Since we listed the roman numerals in upper case, we check against the upper case, and add *m* to the chord if the roman numeral in the progression is in lower case. Indeed, `chord == chord.lower()` will be equal to True if i is in lower case, False otherwise. Since in Python `False == 0` and `True == 1`, we multiply the string "m" by 1 if in lower case (giving us one "m") and 0 if not (giving us ""). This is added to the chords name found by `self.scale[rom_num.index(chord.upper())]`. The final tuple is created by iterating over all of the degrees in the progression.

For example with our C major scale and our 4 chords progression:

- C: degree is I, which is in index 0 of the `rom_num` list, so corresponding to the first note (index 0) in our scale , C
- G: degree is V, which is in index 4 of the `rom_num` list, so corresponding to the fifth note (index 4) in our scale , G
- Am: degree is vi, which is in index 5 of the `rom_num` list, so corresponding to the sixth note (index 5) in our scale, A. The degree is in lower case so `"vi"=="vi".lower()` is True and therefore we add "m", giving us Am.
- F: degree is IV, which is in index 3 of the `rom_num` list, so corresponding to the fourth note (index 3) in our scale , F

We can try it out:

```python
>>> MC = MagicHat()
>>> MC.magic_chords
('C', 'G', 'Am', 'F')
>>> MD = MagicHat("D")
>>> MD.magic_chords
('D', 'A', 'Bm', 'G')
```

And here we go, we have a magic hat that gives us magic chord progressions. The final code looks like this:

```python
notes = ('A', 'A#', 'B', 'C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#')


def generate_scale(scale_name):
    tonic = scale_name.split("m")[0]
    i = notes.index(tonic)
    if "m" in scale_name:
        pattern = (0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10)  # (whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole)
    else:
        pattern = (0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11)  # (whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half)
    return tuple((notes[(i+j) % len(notes)] for j in pattern))


class MagicHat:
    def __init__(self, scale="C"):
        self.scale = generate_scale(scale)
        self.magic_chords = self.generate_chords()

    def generate_chords(self, progression="I, V, vi, IV"):
        chords = progression.replace(" ", "").split(",")
        rom_num = ["I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII"]
        return tuple((self.scale[rom_num.index(i.upper())]+"m"*(i == i.lower()) for i in chords))  # adds m if lowercase
```


Now this is a very simple hat, giving us the magic chords in text. We will try next time to add some functionalities to make it a little more fun and complicate our magic hat a little bit, so that it feels more and more magical!
